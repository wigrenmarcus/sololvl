                <h2>Sung Jinwoo</h2>
                <h3>Appearance</h3>
                <p>
                    Jinwoo is a handsome and muscular young man with gray eyes, black hair, and sharp facial features. When using his powers or agitated, his eyes glow bright purple. He is almost always seen wearing dark colors, particularly black.
                    <br><br>
                    Back when he was weak, Jinwoo was a short, scrawny young man with hair long enough to completely cover his ears. His face was also very boyish, which made him look even younger than his sister Jinah, and he tended to dress in a simple blue hoodie and jeans.
                </p>
                <br>
                <h3>Personality</h3>
                <p>
                    Jinwoo is a humble and benevolent individual who cares deeply for his family and has a strong thirst for power. As a result, he is very close to both his sister and his mother, and rarely wastes an opportunity to grow stronger.
                    <br><br>
                    It should be noted that despite being the strongest hunter in the world, Jinwoo is not particularly arrogant and is both polite and easygoing in-person. He is also mostly indifferent to materialistic desires and can be very selfless, as displayed when he teleported to Jeju Island without a second thought to save the other Korean S-Rank Hunters from certain death. In battle, however, he is ruthless, slaughtering his enemies indiscriminately, and even somewhat disdainful, as displayed when he taunted the Ant King for being an insect and mocked the Architect for his flawed design of the System.
                    <br><br>
                    In contrast, back when he was weak, Jinwoo was very timid and insecure due to his incompetence as a hunter and his troubled family situation. Although he cared deeply for his family and spent years risking his life going on raids for their sake, he was secretly ashamed of his circumstances, as displayed when he lied to Joohee about why he had picked up hunting as his job.
                </p>
                <br>
                <h3>History</h3>
                <p>
                    Jinwoo was born 20-25 years before the events of the main storyline to Sung Il-Hwan and Park Kyung-Hye, and had a little sister named Jinah. Ten years prior to the first Double Dungeon Incident, his father was presumed dead when he mysteriously disappeared inside a dungeon during a raid. Six years later, his mother started to develop symptoms of Eternal Slumber and eventually fell into a coma, but not before making her son promise to her that he'd take care of Jinah in her absence.[1]
                    <br><br>
                    With both of his parents out of the picture, Jinwoo was forced to take over as the breadwinner of the family and went on to become a hunter. Due to how unusually weak he was, he quickly became a subject of mockery in the Korean hunter community and was given the disdainful nickname of "The Weakest Hunter of All Mankind."[2] Nevertheless, he persisted and over the next four years, managed to financially support both himself and his sister even though he nearly died on just about every raid he went on.

                <h2>Go Gunhee</h2>
                <h3>Apperance</h3>
                <p>
                    Gunhee was a muscular old man with gray hair, greenish-gray eyes, and numerous scars on his body. When using his powers, his eyes glowed bright yellow. As a high-ranking government official, he was usually seen wearing a three-piece suit.
                </p>
                <br>
                <h3>Personality</h3>
                <p>
                    Gunhee was a humble, open, and honest individual who was very appreciative towards those with good morals, but also very distasteful towards those who only aimed for personal gain. As a result, Gunhee had a good relationship with Sung Jinwoo and was widely respected in Korean society. He was also a workaholic to the point that his job affected his health and desired to fight for the greater good, as he yearned to be a hunter again and hated the fact that his age was keeping him down.
                </p>
                <br>
                <h3>History</h3>
                <p>
                    Gunhee was once easily the strongest hunter in Korea. Unfortunately, due to his old age, his body began to lose its ability to handle its own strength and as a result, Gunhee was forced to retire after only a few years of working as a hunter. When healing magic was discovered, Gunhee hoped that it could reverse his age and allow him to get back in the game, but to no avail. With no other options left, Gunhee gave up on ever getting back to working as a hunter and eventually became the Chairman of the Korean Hunters Association.
